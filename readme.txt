Enable moderation requests and notifications by email to all administrators.

== Description ==

By default WordPress sends moderation request of new comments to the e-mail address defined in the [General Settings Subpanel](http://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_General_SubPanel "Settings General SubPanel &laquo; WordPress Codex"). However, you do not have an email address shared between your administrators or a mailing list. In this case, the plugin Notification to all Administrators has been created for you!

Also, WordPress sends notifications to the author of the post only. With the plugin Notification to all Administrators, all your administrators receive this notification.

**Note:** This plugin does not overwrites functions like `wp_mail`, or `wp_notify_moderator`.

= Requirements =

Notification to all Administrators requires `PHP5`.

== Installation ==

Upload the Notifications to all Administrators plugin to your blog, Activate it.  
Enjoy :-)
